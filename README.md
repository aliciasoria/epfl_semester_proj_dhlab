**Automated georegistration of 3D models**

Master semester project at Digital Humanities Laboratory (EPFL)
Author: Alicia Soria GÃ³mez
Supervisor: Albane Descombes
Year: Autumn semester 2021

**Introduction**
This project explores different approaches to achieve automatic geolocalization of points in 3D models.
1) Image matching
2) 3D to 2D matching
3) Synthesized view matching

**Dependencies**
The main libraries employed are:
*ee, folium, cv2, google_streetview, geopy, streetview_functions, defisheye, numpy, plotly.express, matplotlib*

**Results**
The repo includes the Python Notebooks that served as training
- finding features in OpenCV.ipynb
- geolocalization_addresses_geopy.ipynb
- rolexandvortex_project.qgz
- try_to_download_panoramics.ipynb

And those with the final results of each approach:
- OpenMVG training.docx
- aerial_matching.ipynb
- camera_movement_1.ipynb
- gross_localization_to_panoramic.ipynb
- musee_louvre.qgz
